# Project Overview and Questions
This project is an analysis of Hiking Trails near the Columbia River Gorge Region in the Pacific Northwest based on location, family-friendly rating, number of hazards, distance and elevation. These are the questions we used to create our data analysis and visualizations:

    • What trails in the Columbia River Gorge region are the best suited for families and pets?
        ○ Where are the different trails located? 
        ○ What types of trail hazards are found each trail?
        ○ What is relationship between the distance and elevation for each trail?

On our dashboard you will find the following:

# Columbia River Gorge Trail Map
This is a detailed map of the Columbia River Gorge area with visual markers of the geocode locations for the start of each trail in our dataset of hiking trails. The markers are colored based on the diffuclty rating for each trail with red for Diffcult, orange for Moderate, and green for Easy. The map also includes a filter box for multiple Trail Filters that users can use to narrow dowm trails based on trail name, difficulty, distance, and family friendly rating. This map was created using data from the file under the folders resources>cleaned data>all_trails_cleaned_df and the leaflet library for JS. Javascript, HTMl, and CSS coding for this map can be found in the index.html file.
